# mping - Multi-Host Ping Tool

A concurrent ping utility written in Rust for learning modern systems programming concepts.

## Overview

**mping** is a command-line tool that can ping multiple hosts simultaneously and display comprehensive statistics. This project serves as a practical learning exercise for exploring Rust's key features including async programming, error handling, and systems programming.

## Learning Goals

This project demonstrates several important Rust concepts:

- **Async Programming**: Using `tokio` for concurrent network operations
- **Error Handling**: Proper use of `Result<T>` and `anyhow` for error management
- **CLI Development**: Building command-line interfaces with `clap`
- **Network Programming**: ICMP ping implementation using `surge-ping`
- **Data Structures**: Organizing code with structs, enums, and impl blocks
- **Memory Safety**: Zero-cost abstractions and ownership patterns
- **External Crates**: Integration with the Rust ecosystem

## Features

- **Concurrent Pinging**: Ping multiple hosts simultaneously using async/await
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Track sent/received packets, loss rates, and timing statistics
- **Beautiful Output**: Formatted tables with UTF-8 borders using `comfy-table`
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable ping count and delay intervals
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Usage

```bash
# Ping multiple hosts with default settings (5 pings each)
mping google.com 8.8.8.8 cloudflare.com

# Customize ping count and delay
mping -c 10 -d 0.5 example.com 1.1.1.1

# Ping with specific parameters
mping --count 20 --delay 2.0 github.com stackoverflow.com
```

## Sample Output

```
PING 3 hosts with 5 packets each ...

Overall 15 sent, 15 received (0.00 % loss)
